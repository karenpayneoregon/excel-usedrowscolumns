This repository contains code demonstrating how to retrieve the last cell address in an Excel worksheet. 
There are two windows forms projects which rely on two class projects to obtain cells addresses via Excel automation which 
is relatively slow to get the addresses while the third project Spreadsheetlight form and class projects are much faster to get 
the last cell address.
